### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe so, the live demos our instructors provided alongside their thorough walk-throughs and explanations were superb in preparing me for this project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I am definitely more content with my time-management this week, I was able to complete a lot of my work earlier due to this. This was due to adjusting my own schedule tailored to the specific tasks I kept in mind to finish by each milestone day. I intend on continuing to expand on my application's features, and would love to make it more accessible in terms of screen readers, and font adjustments.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My live demo will take place next week, though I was looking forward to presenting this week. I am glad with how my UI came out and think it would be plausible to see on the app market. 

### Open-source libraries used

- NONE

### Shout out

Huge shout-out to Michelle Ordonez! Can't believe we both attend Northwestern yet only had the chance to meet through this internship. Even though I had implemented a modal last week, instead of using buttons I used a State Hook, of which Michelle helped walk me through the logic necessary, which had me stumped for a while.
